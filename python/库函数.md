#### `isinstance `

```python
isinstance(obj, class_or_tuple, /)
    Return whether an object is an instance of a class or of a subclass thereof.

    A tuple, as in ``isinstance(x, (A, B, ...))``, may be given as the target to
    check against. This is equivalent to ``isinstance(x, A) or isinstance(x, B)
    or ...`` etc.

# 例子
isinstance(1, int) # True
isinstance(1, object) # True
isinstance(bool, int) # False
isinstance(bool, (int, object)) # True
from collections.abc import Iterable
isinstance((i for i in range(10)), Iterable) #
```

#### `iter`

```python
iter(...)
    iter(iterable) -> iterator
    iter(callable, sentinel) -> iterator

    Get an iterator from an object.  In the first form, the argument must
    supply its own iterator, or be a sequence.
    In the second form, the callable is called until it returns the sentinel.
    
# 例子
from collections.abc import Iterator
isinstance(iter([]), Iterator) # True
isinstance(iter('abc'), Iterator) # True
```
