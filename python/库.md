#### `isinstance `

```python
isinstance(obj, class_or_tuple, /)
    Return whether an object is an instance of a class or of a subclass thereof.

    A tuple, as in ``isinstance(x, (A, B, ...))``, may be given as the target to
    check against. This is equivalent to ``isinstance(x, A) or isinstance(x, B)
    or ...`` etc.

# 例子
isinstance(1, int) # True
isinstance(1, object) # True
isinstance(bool, int) # False
isinstance(bool, (int, object)) # True
from collections.abc import Iterable
isinstance((i for i in range(10)), Iterable) #
```

#### `iter`

```python
iter(...)
    iter(iterable) -> iterator
    iter(callable, sentinel) -> iterator

    Get an iterator from an object.  In the first form, the argument must
    supply its own iterator, or be a sequence.
    In the second form, the callable is called until it returns the sentinel.
    
# 例子
from collections.abc import Iterator
isinstance(iter([]), Iterator) # True
isinstance(iter('abc'), Iterator) # True
```

#### `id`

```python
id(obj, /)
    Return the identity of an object.

    This is guaranteed to be unique among simultaneously existing objects.
    (CPython uses the object's memory address.)
```

#### `map`

```python
class map(object)
 |  map(func, *iterables) --> map object
 |
 |  Make an iterator that computes the function using arguments from
 |  each of the iterables.  Stops when the shortest iterable is exhausted.
```

#### `functools.reduce`

```python
reduce(...)
    reduce(function, sequence[, initial]) -> value

    Apply a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of a sequence,
    from left to right, so as to reduce the sequence to a single value.
    For example, reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) calculates
    ((((1+2)+3)+4)+5).  If initial is present, it is placed before the items
    of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the
    sequence is empty.
```

#### `filter`

```python
class filter(object)
 |  filter(function or None, iterable) --> filter object
 |
 |  Return an iterator yielding those items of iterable for which function(item)
 |  is true. If function is None, return the items that are true.
```
